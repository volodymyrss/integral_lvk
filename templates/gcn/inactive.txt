The INTEGRAL spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit and the
instruments are not acquiring science data during perigee passage,
every 2.6 days to prevent radiation-induced damages. Unfortunately, at the time
of the \VAR{icevent.event_name} (\VAR{icevent.event_time.utc|format_utc}) the
spacecraft was preparing to the start the observations after the
perigee passage between the orbits number \VAR{integral.orbit_before} and \VAR{integral.orbit_after} and no
scientific instrument data are available between 
\VAR{integral.last_data_utc[:19]} and \VAR{integral.first_data_utc[:19]}.
